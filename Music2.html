    They set out for Bremen, a magical, musical land where you can live with hope, compassion, love and inspiration. They have no idea how to get there, and as they follow some nonsensical directions they've received, they come upon a house in the woods filled with food, drink and money. But the house is also filled with a band of lethal-looking robbers who have a secret identity. The animals decide to sing to them, hoping to get food in return.
